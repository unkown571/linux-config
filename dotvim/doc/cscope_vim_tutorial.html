<h2>The Vim/Cscope tutorial</h2>

</center>

<p>Cscope is a very handy tool, but it's even better when you don't ever have to
leave the comfort of your favorite editor (i.e. Vim) to use it.  Fortunately,
Cscope support has been built into Vim.

<p>This tutorial introduces you both to Vim's built-in Cscope support, and to a
set of maps that make searching more convenient.  

<p>It is assumed you know the basics of using a vi-style editor, but you don't
need any particular knowledge about Vim (where Vim-specific features--like
multiple windows--are used, a working knowledge of the features is briefly
introduced).  You also don't need to know anything about Cscope: the basics are
introduced as we go along.

<p>In a nutshell, Vim's Cscope support is very similar to Vim's <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">ctags</a> features,
in case you've used those.  But since Cscope has more search types than ctags,
there are a few differences.

<p>This is a hands-on tutorial, so open up a shell, and follow these steps:

<ol>
    <li>Get and install Cscope if you don't have it already on your machine.
    Ideally, you will also have Vim 6.x, but you can get most of the
    functionality with later versions of Vim 5 (vertical splits don't work, but
    horizontal splits will work if you modify the maps as described in the
    file's comments).  
    
    <p><i>Note: If your version of Vim wasn't compiled with '--enable-cscope',
        you will need to reconfigure and recompile Vim with that flag.  Most
        Vim binaries that ship with Linux distributions have the Cscope
        plugin enabled.</i>

    <p><li>Download the <a href="cscope_maps.vim">cscope_maps.vim</a> file, and
    arrange for it to be read by Vim at startup time. If you are using Vim 6.x,
    stick the file in your $HOME/.vim/plugin directory (or in any other 'plugin'
    subdirectory in your 'runtimepath').  If you are using Vim 5.x, you can
    either cut and paste the entire contents of the cscope_maps file into your
    $HOME/.vimrc file, or stick a "source cscope_maps.vim" line into your .vimrc
    file.

    <p><li>Go into a directory with some C code in it, and enter 'cscope -R'
    (the '-R' makes Cscope parse all subdirectories, not just the current
    directory).  Since we aren't passing the '-b' flag (which tells Cscope to
    just build the database, then exit), you will also find yourself inside
    Cscope's curses-based GUI.  Try a couple of searches (hint: you use the
    arrow keys to move around between search types, and 'tab' to switch between
    the search types and your search results).  Hit the number at the far left
    of a search result, and Cscope will open Vim right to that location.
    (unless you've set your EDITOR environment variable to something besides
    Vim).  Exit Vim, and you'll be right back in the Cscope GUI where you left
    off.  Nifty.
    
    <p>Alas, the Cscope interface has one big problem: you need to exit Vim each
    time you want to do a new search.  That's where the Vim plugin comes in.
    Hit CTRL-D to exit Cscope.

    <p><li>Start up Vim.  If you want, you can start it with a C symbol (ex:
    'vim -t main'), and you should hop right to the definition of that symbol
    in your code. 

    <p><li>Put the cursor over a C symbol that is used in several places in your
    program.  Type "CTRL-\ s" (Control-backslash, then just 's') in quick
    succession, and you should see a menu at the bottom of your Vim window
    showing you all the uses of the symbol in the program.  Select one of them
    and hit enter, and you'll jump to that use.  As with ctags, you can hit
    "CTRL-t" to jump back to your original location before the search (and you
    can nest searches and CTRL-t will unwind them one at a time). 
    
    <p><i>Mnemonic: the '\' key is right next to the ']' key, which is used for
        ctags searches.</i>

    <p><li>Try the same search, but this time via "CTRL-spacebar s".  This time,
    your Vim window will split in two horizontally , and the Cscope search
    result will be put in the new window. [if you've never used multiple Vim
    windows before: move between windows via 'CTRL-W w' (or CTRL-W arrow key, or
    CTRL-W h/j/k/l for left/up/down/right), close a window via 'CTRL-W c' (or
    good old ':q'), make the current window the only one via 'CTRL-W o', split a
    window into two via 'CTRL-W s' (or 'CTRL-W v' for a vertical split), open a
    file in a new window via ':spl[it] filename']

    <p><i>Mnemonic: there's now a big, spacebar-like bar across the middle of your
        screen separating your Vim windows.</i>
    
    <p><table border=0 align="center" width=75%>
        <tr><td align="RIGHT"><img src="pics/cscope_flip.jpg"></td></tr>
       </table>

    <p><li>Now try the same search via "CTRL-spacebar CTRL-spacebar s" (just
    hold down the CTRL key and tap the spacebar twice). If you have trouble
    hitting the keys fast enough for this to work, go into the cscope_maps.vim
    script and change Vim's timeout settings as described in the comments
    [actually, I generally recommend that you turn off Vim's timeouts].  This
    time your Vim window will be split vertically (note: this doesn't work with
    Vim 5.x, as vertical splits are new with Vim 6.0).

    <p><li>Up to now we've only been using the keystroke maps from
    'cscope_maps.vim', which all do a search for the term that happens to be
    under your cursor in Vim.  To do Cscope searches the old-fashioned way
    (using Vim's built-in Cscope support), enter ":cscope find symbol foo" (or,
    more tersely, ":cs f s foo").  To do the horizontal split version, use
    ":scscope" (or just ":scs") instead (Vim 6.x only).  While it's easier to
    use the maps if the word you want to search for is under your cursor, the
    command line interface lets you go to any symbol you type in, so you'll
    definitely want to use it at times.

    <p><li>So far we've only been doing one kind of search: 's', for 'find all
    uses of symbol X'.  Try doing one of Cscope's other searches by using a
    different letter:  'g' finds the global definition(s) of a symbol, 'c'
    finds all calls to a function, 'f' opens the filename under the cursor
    (note: since Cscope by default parses all C header files it finds in
    /usr/include, you can open up most standard include files with this).
    Those are the ones I use most frequently, but there are others (look in the
    cscope_maps.vim file for all of them, and/or read the Cscope man page).

    <p><li>Although Cscope was originally intended only for use with C code,
    it's actually a very flexible tool that works well with languages like C++
    and Java. You can think of it as a generic 'grep' database,
    with the ability to recognize certain additional constructs like function
    calls and variable definitions.  By default Cscope only parses C, lex, and
    yacc files (.c, .h, .l, .y) in the current directory (and subdirectories, if
    you pass the -R flag), and there's currently no way to change that list of
    file extensions (yes, we ought to change that).  So instead you have to make
    a list of the files that you want to parse, and call it 'cscope.files' (you
    can call it anything you want if you invoke 'cscope -i foofile').  An easy
    (and very flexible) way to do this is via the trusty Unix 'find' command:
<pre>
    find . -name '*.java' &gt; cscope.files
</pre>
    Now run 'cscope -b' to rebuild the database (the -b just builds the database
    without launching the Cscope GUI), and you'll be able to browse all the
    symbols in your Java files.  Apparently there are folks out there using
    Cscope to browse and edit large volumes of documentation files, which shows
    how flexible Cscope's parser is.

    <p>For larger projects, you may additionally need to use the <tt>-q</tt> 
    flag, and/or use a more sophisticated 'find' command.  See our <a href="large_projects.html">tutorial on
    using Cscope with large projects</a> for more info.

    <table border=0 align="center" width=75%>
        <tr><td align="center"><img src="pics/cscope_chop.jpg"></td></tr>
       </table>

    <p><li>Try setting the $CSCOPE_DB environment variable to point to a Cscope
    database you create, so you won't always need to launch Vim in the same
    directory as the database. This is particularly useful for projects where
    code is split into multiple subdirectories.  Note: for this to work, you
    should build the database with absolute pathnames: cd to /, and do 
<pre>
    find /my/project/dir -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' &gt; /foo/cscope.files
</pre>
    Then run Cscope in the same directory as the cscope.files file (or use
    'cscope -i /foo/cscope.files'), then set and export the $CSCOPE_DB variable,
    pointing it to the cscope.out file that results):
<pre>
    cd /foo
    cscope -b
    CSCOPE_DB=/foo/cscope.out; export CSCOPE_DB   
</pre>
    (The last command above is for Bourne/Korn/Bash shells: I've forgotten how
    to export variables in csh-based shells, since I avoid them like the
    plague).

    <p>You should now be able to run 'vim -t foo' in any directory on your
    machine and have Vim jump right to the definition of 'foo'.  I tend to write
    little shell scripts (that just define and export CSCOPE_DB) for all my
    different projects, which lets me switch between them with a simple 'source
    projectA' command.
    
    <table border="0"i cellpadding="4">
        <tr><td valign="middle"><img src="pics/cscope_gui.jpg"></td>
            <td><i>BUG: in versions of Cscope prior to
        15.4, there is a silly bug that may cause Vim to freeze when you do this
        unless you call your database something other than the default
        'cscope.out': use '-f foo' in your Cscope invocation to name your
        database 'foo.out' instead, and you'll be OK.</i></td></tr></table>

    <p><li>That's it! Use ":help cscope" (in Vim) and/or "man cscope" (from your
    shell) if you've got questions, and to learn the fine points.
